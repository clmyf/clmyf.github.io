A modified Levenberg–Marquardt methods for solving system of nonlinear equations is described and analysed in this paper. Specifically, we propose a convex combination of $\|F_k\|^{\delta}$ and $\|J_k^{\mathrm{T}} F_k\|^{\delta}$ with $\delta\in[1,2]$ for the LM parameter and analyse the convergence of this modified Levenberg–Marquardt method under the H\"olderian local error bound of the underlying function and the v-Hölderian continuity of its Jacobian. The results show that, under some suitable relationships of exponents $v$, $\gamma$ and $\delta$, the modified Levenberg–Marquardt method converges to the solution set of the system of nonlinear equations at least superlinearly. Numerical experiments show the new algorithm is efficient.
